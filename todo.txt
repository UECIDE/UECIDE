Compiler.java
 - Eliminate the need to pass a Target into the compiler by having the Compiler determine the current target (by checking the preferences directly)?
 - Delete the unneeded static functions (for classpath translation, etc.) from the bottom of the file. 

Sketch.java
 - add system-wide include path in preprocess()?
 - should find libraries in the code/ sub-folder of the sketch folder
 - do sketches really need to get built in the applet/ sub-folder when uploading?

PreProcessor.java
 - split write() into writeHeader() and write() as in Processing?
 - add getExtraImports() function instead of having Sketch grab them directly.

Base.java
 - add keywords from libraries to the syntax coloring

Editor.java
 - allow the Board and Serial port to differ across editor windows.  This will require creating a separate instance of the menu for each window, and passing the selections into the sketch when compiling or uploading.
 - send the current board and serial port selections to the sketch (which will forward them to the compiler) when compiling or uploading (this should eliminate the need for the Target class, since the compiler will be able to find the target path and its source files itself)
 - remove references to the Runner and runtime
