  within interrupts.

ARDUINO 0013 - 2009.02.06

[documentation / examples]
* Adding examples for Parallax Ping Sensor and Memsic 2125 accelerometer.

[core / libraries]
* Adding support for the ATmega328.  The upload speed is 57600 baud, so you
  may need to edit boards.txt or reburn your bootloader if you bought an 
  ATmega328 w/ bootloader from adafruit or other supplier.
* Adding support for printing floats to Print class (meaning that it works
  in the Serial, Ethernet, and LiquidCrystal classes too).  Includes two
  decimal places.

  lowByte(), and highByte(); see reference for details.
* Working around problem that caused PWM output on pins 5 and 6 to never go
  to 0 (causing, for example, an LED to continue to glow faintly).
* Removing cast macros, since function-style casts are a feature of C++.  This
  should fix contributed libraries that broke in Arduino 0012.
* Modifying pulseIn() to wait for a transition to start timing (i.e. ignoring
  any pulse that had already started when the function was called).
* Fixing bug in random() that limited the ranges of values generated.  Thanks
  to Mikal Hart.
* Modifying delay() to pause for at least the given number of milliseconds.
* Fixing bug in Ethernet library that interfered with use of pins 8 and 9.
* Originating each outgoing network connection from a different port (in the
  Client class of the Ethernet library).  Thanks to Paul and joquer.
* Updating ATmega168 bootloader to work with standard distributions of avrdude
  (responding to signature requests made with the universal SPI command) and
  correctly store EEPROM data.  Thanks to ladyada.
  
[environment]

  now uses slightly more processing power.
* Fixed reversing direction bug in Stepper library.  (Thanks to Wayne Holder.)
* Moved insertion of #include <WProgram.h> to after any comments and #include
  statements in the main sketch file.  This means that an #include <stdlib.h>
  now works.
* Upgraded to newer versions of avr-gcc (4.3.0) and avr-libc (1.6).  This
  provides support for newer Atmel chips, but may increase the size
  of sketches.
* Allowing per-board specification of the upload.using preference, allowing
  upload via bootloader to some boards and via a programmer to others.
* Added return values to some functions in the Wire library to allow for
  better error handling.
* Fixed random() to work with long values.
* Creation of an abstract Print base-class to allow Serial, SoftwareSerial,
  and LiquidCrystal to share code for print() and println().
* Incorporated ladyada's watchdog timer mods to the bootloader source, but
  only compiling them in for the Pro and Pro Mini (because they are included
  in the bootloader being burned on the boards by SparkFun).

* Updated examples (in distribution and on the website).
* Added an EEPROM library (see reference for details).
* Added a Stepper motor library (see reference).

* Added support for analog inputs 6 and 7 and pwm on pins 5 and 6 on the
  on the ATmega168 used in the Arduino Mini (extra analog inputs not available
  in DIP ATmega168s).

  rerun macosx_setup.command.

ARDUINO 0003 - 2006.01.16

API Changes
* Reversed the analog input pins to correspond to newer boards.  This means
  a call, for example, to analogRead(0) must be changed to analogRead(5) in
  order to read the same physical pin.
* Added a printNewline() function (which sends '\n' = ASCII 10).

New Stuff
* Reference is included (features native to C not yet documented).

  rate is controlled by the Serial Monitor Baud Rate Menu, defaults to 9600.
  Icon and implementation from Wiring.
* Serial port menu now automatically refreshes when opened.
* New blue color scheme and icons courtesy of Noah Shibley (colors are hardcoded
  into the source to ensure consistency with image files).
* Keyspan and FTDI USB drivers included with Mac and Windows distributions.

Bug Fixes

  dist).

Other
* Upload rate no longer selectable from a menu within the IDE.  Instead, edit
  the serial.download_rate item in the preferences.txt file.
* Created Xcode project for building Arduino on the Mac (doesn't yet regenerate
  the grammar files or package the distribution); active target should be "App".
* Removed unused or unimplemented items from menus.

ARDUINO 0001 - 2005.08.25 

* This is the first released of the unified IDE + language library
  it's a terrible hack... but it works. at the moment it's in alpha stage
  but it can be used to work.
* The processing preprocessor is included but not used.
