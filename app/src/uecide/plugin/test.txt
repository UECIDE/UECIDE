How To Build
============

A number of changes have been made to how the system builds.  There is now
a couple of configuration files which you need to be aware of - the main one
being build.settings.

This file contains a number of key=value pairs for setting different options
while building.  An example:

version=0.0.1pre
theme=uecide
#core.pic32=yes
core.avr105=yes
#core.msp430=yes
boards.Arduino=yes
#boards.Cerebot=yes
#boards.CUI32=yes
#boards.Majenko=yes
#boards.MicroElektronika=yes
#boards.PONTECH=yes
#boards.chipKIT=yes
#boards.Fubarino=yes
#boards.Microchip=yes
#boards.Olimex=yes
#boards.UBW32=yes

Lines starting with a # are ignored.  The settings are:

version
  The current version of the IDE - update this as you see fit.

theme
  The selected theme - themes reside in the themes directory - see the section
  on themes further down

core.*
  Cores to include in the build.  Cores are downloaded at build time, so only
  the cores that you have selected will be downloaded and unpacked into the 
  build tree.  It doesn't matter what you set these to, if they exist (not
  commented out) the will be included.

boards.*
  Board packs to download and include.  Be sure to also include the right core
  to support the boards you choose.  Again, it doesn't matter what you set
  them to.


Themes
======

The build system now selects graphics and other theme information (including
even the name of the finished IDE) from the themes directory.  Much of the files
in the theme directory are as per the original Arduino IDE except they have been
upgraded to PNG format.  However, the "buttons.gif" file has now been replaced
by a selection of PNG icons (22x22 is a good size) for the toolbar icons.

The theme directory is split into two areas - the IDE, and Windows areas.  The
IDE area is used for themeing the main IDE, while the Windows area is used
for the launch4j stub program for Windows.

A few new entries have been added to the standard theme.txt file:

  about.version.x = 365
  about.version.y = 215
  about.version.color = #656565
  about.version.font = SansSerif,normal,14

These set the position, colour and font of the version number which is added to
the "about.png" graphic (which is shown when you select "Help -> About ...").

  product=uecide
  product.cap=UECIDE

You set the name of the IDE with these.  This affects all references to the name
of the IDE within the IDE itself, and also during the build process for naming
files.
