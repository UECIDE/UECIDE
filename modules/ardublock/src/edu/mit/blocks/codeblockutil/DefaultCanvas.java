/**
 * A Canvas is a low-level, mutable, CSwing component.
 * It is the UI component onto which other UI components
 * are added.
 * 
 * An explorer, for example, may have a set of canvases that it
 * controls and displays.
 * 
 * A Navigator may take a set of canvases and control them
 * in some complex way that mimicks real life experiences
 * (such as sliding, fading, flying).
 * 
 * A canvas should be the only part of a high-level CSwing
 * object that users may manipulate.
