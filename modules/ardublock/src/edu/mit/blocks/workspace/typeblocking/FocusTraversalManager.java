/**
 * The FocusTraversalManager has two function.  First, it 
 * maintains a pointer to the block, if any, that has 
 * focus and the corresponding focus point on that block.  
 * If the focus is not on the block, then it must be set 
 * to some point of the block canvas.
 * 
 * The second primary function of the FocusTraversalManager 
 * is to redirect the focus to the next appropriate block 
 * in a particular stack.  One could "traverse" the stack 
 * by moving the focus to one of the following:
 * 		1. the block after
 * 		2. the block before
 * 		3. the next block
 * 		4. the previous block
 * 
 * The exact definition of what "next", "previous", 
 * "after", and "before" is described in details in 
 * their corresponding method summary.
 * As a focus manager of the entire system, the class 
 * must maintain particular invariants at all time.  
 * Clients of this module may obtain the focus through 
 * three observer (getter) methods.  Clients may also 
 * manualy mutate the focus through three modifier (setter) 
 * methods.
 * 
 * However, BOTH the value returned in the observer 
 * methods and the value passed in the modifier methods 
 * MUST maintain particular invariants described below.
 * 
 * These invariants must hold at all time and check reps 
 * should be imposed to ensure that any changes to the 
 * system still holds these crucial invariants.  Clients 
 * of this module may assume that the invariants mentioned 
 * below will always hold.
 * 
 * INVARIANT I.
 * 	If the canvas has focus, then the block does not. Thus
 * 		1. focusBlock == Block.null
 * 		2. canvasFocusPoint != null
 * 		3. blockFocusPoint == null
 * 
 * INVARIANT II.
 * 	If the block has focus, then the canvas does not. Thus
 * 		1. focusBlock != Block.null
 * 		2. canvasFocusPoint == null
 * 		3. blockFocusPoint != null
 * 
 * @specfield focusBlock : Long //block with focus
 * @specfield canvasFocusPoint : Point //focus point on canvas relative to canvas
 * @specfield blockFocusPoint : Point //focus point on block relative to block
