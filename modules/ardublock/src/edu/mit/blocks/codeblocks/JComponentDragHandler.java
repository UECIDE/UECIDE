/**
 * This class can be used to add dragging capability to any JComponents.
 * It contains the methods and data members needed to support automatic dragging,
 * and contains methods to impliment both MouseListener, MouseMotionListener.
 * In general, any existing JComponent can be made to be draggable simple by
 * creating an instance of JComponentDragHandler (passing a reference to itself)
 * and registering the JComponentDragHandler as the listener for all mouse events.
 *
 * Classes that need similar, but not identical, behavior, or that need to add
 * functionality to the mouse methods here can create an inner class that extends
 * this class.  In this way the inner class can maintain the functionality of
 * JComponentDragHandler while also having access to data members and methods
 * of its enclosing class for the purposes of extension.
