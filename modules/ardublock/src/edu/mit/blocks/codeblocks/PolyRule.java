/*** About poly rule *****************************************************************************************************
 * 
 * PolyRule checks linking ability of poly connectors and handles setting/reverting them to/from different types.
 * There are two types of poly connectors, regular "poly" (POLY SINGLE) and "poly-list (POLY LIST). POLY SINGLE
 * can attach to anything, unless it is operating on a list (in which case we prevent it from accepting any list
 * types) so that we avoid multi-level nested lists. POLY LIST can attach to any type of list.
 * 
 * ** General note:
 * 		The majority of the complications in dealing with poly connectors has to do with differentiating between
 * 			POLY SINGLE and POLY LIST, since POLY SINGLE is more general and can be set to POLY LIST type. 
 * 		The other complication occurs with multi-level nested lists not being allowed, but this may not always be
 * 			the case, so we try to abstract this check, in case we want to change it in the future (should we want
 * 			to allow multi-level nested lists, change "canLinkList", "setPolyKind", and "revertPolyKind").
 *
*** Vocabulary for the code description of this class is defined here with examples. ************************************
 *
 * 	Connector types:
 *  - POLY:			(polymorphous, i.e. can change types)
 * 	- POLY SINGLE:	conn type = "poly":						single hook (such as in "say")
 *  - POLY LIST:	conn type = "poly-list":				double hook (such as in "length" of list)
 *  - TYPED:		(not poly, i.e. cannot change types)
 *  - TYPED LIST:	conn type does not contain poly and contains "list":
 *  														(three cases: "boolean-list", "number-list", "string-list")
 *  - TYPED SINGLE:	conn type does not not poly and does not contain "list":
 *  														(all other cases, ex. "boolean", "number", "string")
 *  
 *  Block types:
 *  - LIST-RELATED:	block type = contains a list socket (includes "list" block and all list operators, like "add-to-list")
 *  	*special because: LIST-RELATED blocks are an exception case during POLY connector linking.
 *  - PROC-RELATED: block type = either a procedure declaration or procedure call block
 *  	*special because: PROC-RELATED blocks are an exception case during POLY connector setting/reverting.
 *  
 *  Setting/reverting terminology:
 *  - POLY CONN:	a connector of POLY type that needs to be set/reverted.
 *  - SETTER CONN:	a connector of any type that tells a POLY CONN what to set/revert to.

/*** Setting/reverting POLY connector types: *****************************************************************************
 *
 *--Basic idea:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 *  	Connectors must be consistent a) across a link and b) within a block.
 *  
 *  	Therefore, the basic idea of POLY connector setting/reverting is that the initial connector that was part of
 *  		the connected/disconnected link changes type, and it propagates the new type information to the other
 *  		POLY connectors in the same block, which each propagate the new type information to the POLY connectors
 *  		they are connected to, which each propagate the new type information to the other POLY connectors in their
 *  		blocks, and so on. The process repeats until there are no POLY connectors left to convert.
 *  			* The exception is if the POLY connector is in a PROC-RELATED block, in which case the conversion
 *  				does not propagate to the other POLY connectors in the block because procedures can take many types.
 *  
 *  	--> Technical note: The recursion always proceeds from one initial connector outwards in a single direction,
 *  		meaning that if the connector may receive information across a link and propagate it to the rest of the
 *  		block, or the other way around, but not both. We keep track of the ID of the last block checked so that
 *  		the recursion doesn't travel backwards onto blocks we've already checked, preventing infinite loop.

/***Setting type specifics (case BLOCK_CONNECTED): ***********************************************************************
 * 
 *--Initiation:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 	-	When two blocks are connected, we must first determine which, if any, is the connector that needs to be set.
 *  		To do this, we order the "degree of poly-ness" for the connectors, and only when the "degree of poly-ness"
 *  		differs between the connectors does the one with the lower degree (SETTER CONN) pass type information to
 *  		the one with the higher degree (POLY CONN).
 *  			"Degree of poly-ness": 1) POLY SINGLE, 2) POLY LIST, 3) TYPED
 *  		
 *  		The consequence of this is the following behavior:
 *  			a) both connectors are the same type -> no information passed, do nothing
 *  			b) one connector is POLY SINGLE and other is not -> other passes type to POLY SINGLE
 *  			c) one connector is POLY LIST, and other is TYPED LIST -> other passes type to POLY LIST
 *  		This allows POLY SINGLE to be set to POLY LIST, and not the other way around, though both are POLY.
 *  
 *--The recursion:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  -	Once we determine the connector that needs to be set, we begin the recursive setting. The original lower degree
 *  		connector is passed in as the SETTER CONN, and after it changes the type of the POLY CONN, the POLY CONN
 *  		becomes the new SETTER CONN and the other POLY connectors in the block are queued to become the next POLY CONN.
 *  
 *--How to set a type:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *  		NEW TYPE:			type of the SETTER CONN
 *  		SINGLE VERSION:		prefix of the NEW TYPE
 *  		LIST VERSION:		prefix of the NEW TYPE + "-list"

 *  		Ex.		(	NEW TYPE = boolean 		->	SINGLE VERSION = boolean	->	LIST VERSION = boolean-list
 *  				 	NEW TYPE = boolean-list ->	SINGLE VERSION = boolean	->	LIST VERSION = boolean-list	)
 *  
 *  -	Rules:
 *  	1)	If the POLY CONN is a POLY SINGLE
 *  		a) If the SETTER CONN is SINGLE --> set to NEW TYPE.
 *  		b) If the SETTER CONN is LIST,
 *  			i) If the POLY CONN is not in a LIST-RELATED block --> set to NEW TYPE.
 *  			i) Else --> set to SINGLE VERSION. (i.e. when there is a mix of LIST and SINGLE in the block, stay SINGLE)

*//***Reverting type specifics (case BLOCK_DISCONNECTED): ******************************************************************
 * 
 *--Initiation:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 		-	When two blocks are disconnected, both connectors need to be set back to their original types, if possible.
 * 			We check that it is possible to revert a connector by checking that it is POLY type and that there are no blocks
 * 			still connected to it dictating the type. The latter is determined by recursively checking connected blocks
 * 			for POLY connectors that cannot revert.
 * 
 *--The recursion:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 		-	Once we determine if the connector can be reverted, we begin the recursive reverting. The process is similar
 * 			to the setting type recursion, except for the first round. During the first iteration, we use the initial
 * 			disconnected connector to revert the types of the OTHER connectors within its OWN block. In future iterations,
 * 			a reverted connector reverts the types of ALL connectors of the NEXT connected block. The reverted connector
 * 			becomes the SETTER CONN and connectors of the next block are the POLY CONN. The reason for this initial round
 * 			is that when a block disconnects, there is no connector connected to the initial block to be the SETTER CONN.
 *
 *  		--> Technical note: We only have to check that we can revert for the initial connector and not during the recursion
 *  				because the initial check was already recursive and had checked the rest along the way.
 *  
 *--How to revert a type:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 	-	When we revert a type, we know the initial type of the SETTER CONN and the current type of the SETTER CONN.
 * 		Vocabulary:
 * 			INITIAL TYPE:	either POLY SINGLE or POLY LIST (since we've already checked the connector is POLY)
 * 			CURRENT TYPE:	anything (since the connector may or may not have been reverted)
 * 			POLY VERSION:	suffix of the TYPE
 * 
 * 			Ex.		(	TYPE = boolean	->	POLY VERSION = poly
 * 					 	TYPE = boolean-list	->	POLY VERSION = poly-list	)
 * 
 * 	-	Rules:
 * 		1)	If the POLY CONN and SETTER CONN have the same INITIAL TYPE (both POLY or both POLY-LIST)
 * 				--> set POLY CONN CURRENT TYPE to SETTER CONN CURRENT TYPE.
 * 		2)	Else (one POLY and other POLY-LIST)
 * 				--> set POLY CONN CURRENT TYPE to POLY VERSION of POLY CONN CURRENT TYPE.
 * 				(Ex. if we have "say"-"list"-"1", and we remove the "1", the "list" socket reverts from number
 * 					to its original poly, the "list" plug reverts from number-list to its original poly-list,
 * 					BUT the "say" socket reverts from number-list to poly-list and NOT its original poly.)
