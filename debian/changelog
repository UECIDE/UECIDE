uecide (0.8.7x) unstable; urgency=low 

  * Embarked on a daring resign
  * I have started redesigning much of the system from the ground up.  Instead

  * it's so crippled as to be pretty much unusable.  Lots and lots still to do.

  * from the main source tree and either placed into auto-updating third
  * party area or placed in lib folder as .jar files.

uecide (0.8.5e) unstable; urgency=low 

  * Removed early jre version
  * There was a left-over large zip file of JRE 6 for windows hanging
  * around in the Windows dist folder.  It has been removed.
  * Porting to FreeBSD
  * This is the start of an effort to port UECIDE cleanly to FreeBSD, including
  * the ability to build and package it through the FreeBSD ports system.
  * Added version.plist file generation
  * When compiling UECIDE outside of git (say from a downloaded tarball)
  * the version information is not available.  Now, if it's not being
  * compiled inside git, the version information is obtained from a
  * version.plist file.  That file is updated automatically by the
  * build script when compiled from within git.
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:UECIDE/UECIDE
  * Removed the windows JRE from the repo
  * The JRE distribution is now stored online at
  * http://uecide.org/support/jre-7-windows.zip
  * This makes tarball downloads of the repository considerably smaller.
  * The repository will also be pruned to remove the large files
  * historically too.
  * Better default Linux sketchbook location
  * The Linux version now doesn't prompt for a sketchbook location the
  * first time you start the program.  Instead it now, like the other
  * platforms, creates a "UECIDE" folder in your documents folder
  * (/home/foo/Documents/UECIDE) for your sketches.  Of course, if you
  * already have a sketchbook folder elsewhere set up in the preferences.txt
  * file, it will keep using that.
  * Created basic sketch backup system
  * You now have the option to, when saving your sketch, to create a number
  * of backup copies.  The number (and the option) to save is in preferences,
  * and if enabled, it keeps the last N versions of your sketch files in a
  * "backup" folder inside the sketch.  The backups are named <sketchname>-1
  * through to <sketchname>-N, with -1 being the most recent copy.  At the
  * moment it only backs up the files that are able to be edited directly by
  * the IDE, so doesn't include sketch libraries, binary files, etc.
  * Fixed compile abort on sketch error
  * I bug in the compiler system meant that if the sketch (which is compiled
  * first in the list) has an error the compilation continued right to the end
  * resulting in the error being lost up the top of the output.  It now aborts
  * the compilation immediately the sketch compilation fails.

uecide (0.8.5d) unstable; urgency=low 

  * Fixed version display
  * A small unforseen bug in the build script meant that the version string
  * wasn't obtained properly for the core version.  This only really affected
  * the display of the version number on the "About" screen, and was purely
  * cosmetic.
  * Overhaul the UI
  * There have been some rather large (yet subtle) changes to the core UI
  * in this commit.  The open dialog has been changed to a JFileChooser with
  * custom filtering and icon code, so that sketch folders now display as
  * a single file with a UECIDE icon - no more browsing to the sketch folder
  * and then finding the .ino file within it.  Much cleaner.
  * Also the Look-And-Feel system has been completely rewritten.  You now have
  * the ability to select your look and feel (with sensible defaults on a per-
  * operating system basis).  Coupled with that we have now provided a selection
  * of extra Look-And-Feel archives to select from (some work better on some
  * systems than others).  We have the JTattoo collection, which gives lots of
  * very high-quality themes, plus the Liquid KDE theme.  A preferences drop
  * down list selector has been provided to select the theme you want, and the
  * theme changes while you're selecting it, so you can see exactly what you'll
  * get with any one theme.
  * Added ability to select to use the system dectorator
  * Some of the LaF themes use their own decorator.  That doesn't always
  * work properly on all systems as it expects things to be in certain
  * places.  A checkbox has now been added to the preferences to turn off
  * the custom decorators and use the system dectorator instead.  By default
  * now it will use the system dectorator unless specifically told not to.
  * Also in this commit is a small bug-fix to cure a NullPointerException when
  * updating editor menus with no core selected (first installation of any
  * plugins, for instance).
  * Added sketch-level libraries
  * It is now possible to place libraries in a "libraries" folder within your
  * sketch folder.  These libraries are used in preference to any other libraries
  * with the same name in the system.  In addition the archive names used when
  * building libraries have been expanded to include the type of library ("core",
  * "contributed" or "sketch") so that any override libraries in sketches don't
  * mess up the cached archives for other sketches.
  * Save As now also copies the contents of the libraries and objects folders
  * across to the new sketch folder.
  * Expand Save As to include all files
  * The Save As routine has now been expanded to copy all files from the
  * old sketch folder to the new - that is except files that are named
  * sketchname.*

uecide (0.8.5c) unstable; urgency=low 

  * Fixed missing parameter to new format getLibraryCollection()
  * Obtain package version number from git tag
  * Automatically set UECIDE environment variable if unset
  * External third party scripts and makefiles can now access the UECIDE
  * environment variable to get the location of the "settings" directory.
  * This is the directory which contains preferences.txt and also usually
  * the compilers, boards, etc.  For instance, you could now use something
  * like:
  * $ $UECIDE/compilers/pic32-tools/bin/pic32-gcc ....
  * within a script.
  * This commit also standardizes the license boilerplate in all .java files
  * in the main UECIDE core source.
  * Obtain version number from git tag
  * Nw we have transitioned to using git tags for marking release points it makes
  * sense to use those tags themselves for filling in the version number in the
  * IDE when compiling.  Both the master build and the core build scripts use
  * the output of "git tag" as the version number instead of getting it from
  * the version.txt file.
  * Create and populate FileType class
  * The new FileType class describes just what can be done with any of a number
  * of file types.  It is intended to describe to the IDE how different files
  * can be handled in the IDE - whether they can be edited (and how), what
  * syntax highlighting to apply to them, etc.  At the moment it only handles
  * basic information, but eventually it may be expanded to deal with deciding
  * how a certain file type should be compiled (which recipe to use for it)
  * etc.  This should make expanding the system to cover other languages in the
  * future much simpler.
  * Made better use of the build.number in build scripts
  * Traditionally the "Build Number" of a package has been the total number
  * of commits to the git repository since the beginning of time.  That number
  * is destined to grow rather large, and become a bit meaningless.  This small
  * change instead uses the number of commits since the most recent tag - that
  * is, the most recent release version.  That way it's basically the patch
  * level of the current version.  You can easilly see how many changes there
  * have been in your copy of the code since the last official release.  In
  * theory this will always be 0 for publicly released versions, but sometimes
  * a small post-release-tag tweak will be needed, so may be 1 or 2.  The
  * number is of more use to developers who share their builds with other
  * people so that the exact revision number can be determined with ease.
  * Overhaul "external editor" facility
  * Since the introduction of a better editor into UECIDE a long time ago the
  * ability to use an external editor was lost.  This update fixes that by properly
  * disabling the editor's editing ability when external editor is enabled, and
  * whenever the compile button is pressed it reloads all the files back into the
  * IDE before doing anything else.
